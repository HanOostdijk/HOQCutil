\section{Acknowledgement}{

I encountered this function in a contribution by Tommy (\url{https://stackoverflow.com/users/662787/tommy}) in \url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7519790/assign-multiple-new-variables-on-lhs-in-a-single-line}. I adapted the function slightly to allow a character vector for the first argument and derived the binary operator \code{\%ma\%} from it. I also changed the name of the function from \code{vassign} to \code{massign} because the relevant feature is assignment to multiple variables.

\dontrun{
massign(aa,bb, values= c(16,30) )
c('aa','bb') \%ma\% c(16,30)
}
