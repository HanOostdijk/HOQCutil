\usage{
myknit(
  inputFile,
  encoding = getOption("encoding"),
  hoqc_render = TRUE,
  clean = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputFile}{base file to render}

\item{encoding}{encoding of basefile}

\item{hoqc_render}{boolean to indicate that output file is to be created. Default TRUE}

\item{clean}{boolean to indicate that intermediary files are removed. Default TRUE}
}
\description{
myknit can be used to make the process of knitting more flexible.
The Usage and Arguments section specify how the function would be used on a standalone base. \cr\cr
Normally however I do the \code{knit} with the \strong{knit} button in RStudio.
When I include in the yaml metadata block the yaml statement \cr
\code{knit:  (function (...) \{  HOQCutil::myknit(...) \})}
the \code{myknit} code will be run instead of \code{rmarkdown::render}.\cr\cr
The \code{myknit} function removes (R) commented lines from the yaml metadata block and can do one or more of the following things (based on extra YAML statements): \cr
\itemize{
\item specify an alternative name for the output file (based on \code{hoqc_output})
\item append a version indicator to the name of the output file (based on \code{hoqc_version})
\item force that the proper extension is given to the name of the output file (when not specified) (based on \code{hoqc_force_ext})
\item create a file with the yaml metadata block that was specified with a name including the version indicator  (based on \code{hoqc_yaml})
\item create a file with the yaml metadata block after processing with a name including the version indicator (based on \code{hoqc_yaml_new})
\item create a copy of the input file with a name including the version indicator (based on \code{hoqc_rmd_in})
\item create a copy of the processed input file with a name including the version indicator (based on \code{hoqc_rmd_out})
An example of use  is given in the
\href{https://github.com/HanOostdijk/rmd_pdf_examples/blob/master/output/Flex/\%20Knit_v1.pdf}{pdf file}
and the corresponding
\href{https://github.com/HanOostdijk/rmd_pdf_examples/blob/master/flexknit.Rmd}{rmd file} of the GitHub repository
\strong{rmd_pdf_examples}.\cr
Note: in the repository the myknit function is (still) included as a separate function.
