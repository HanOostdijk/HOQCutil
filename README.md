# HOQCutil
This a first attempt to group some utilities that I use into a package.

Currently only the myknit function that I use in the 
[**rmd_pdf_examples repository**](https://github.com/HanOostdijk/rmd_pdf) 
is included

## Install HOQCutil

```R
install.packages("devtools")  
library(devtools)  
install_github("HanOostdijk/HOQCutil") 
```
